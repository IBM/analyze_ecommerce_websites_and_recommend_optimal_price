# Analyze e-commerce websites and recommend optimal price for a product

Any e-commerce vendor who is selling a competitive product online, would want their sales to be maximum. One of the important factor that users see in buying a competitive product is the selling price that the vendor is offering. In order to sell maximum products a vendor would need to give the product at best selling price in the market, without compromising on the desired profits.

In this code pattern, we will develop an interactive UI integrated with custom backend that will help the e-commerce vendors decide on an optimal selling price such that their chances of sales will increase and at the same time maintain their desired profits.
